      <p className="mb-4">
        One day, I attended a <strong>cybersecurity workshop</strong>, and a speaker said something that really stuck with me —
        <em> “Instead of just learning endlessly, try building a project. And if you can’t think of one, start by cloning.”</em>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        That moment motivated me to start this <strong>Taxi Booking App clone</strong>. Before this, I was mainly learning coding
        concepts and had ideas, but I struggled to turn them into real projects.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        By working on this clone, I not only improved my <strong>coding skills</strong> but also gained
        <strong> hands-on experience</strong> and came up with <strong>three new project ideas</strong> of my own.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In this project i understand how to go from just <strong>learning</strong> to actually <strong>building</strong> something real —
        and that’s what made this journey truly valuable. 
      </p>
    </div>
